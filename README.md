mutating arrays:


mapping arrays: array.map(function(currentValue, index, arr), thisValue)  

## **Day 23**  
went over hw and discussed mid term

mapping and filtering  
The map() method creates a new array with the results of calling a function for every array element.

The map() method calls the provided function once for each element in an array, in order.

Note: map() does not execute the function for array elements without values.

Note: this method does not change the original array.
